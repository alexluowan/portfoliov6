## INTRO (40 seconds)

"Hi, I'm Alex. I'm currently a product designer at AthenaHQ, where I work on AI-powered tools for enterprise workflows. It's been a great experience, but I'm looking for something more B2C—products where I can see real people using what I build, not just dashboards for internal teams.

That's what drew me to Whop. You're building tools that help creators run their businesses, and I'm excited about the direct connection between design decisions and user outcomes. Plus, you're tackling a challenge I've spent a lot of time on: helping users trust automated systems.

I'll walk you through two projects that show how I think about these problems."

## BLUEBERRY SOCIAL (90 seconds)

### The Problem (20 sec)
"Blueberry is an AI tool that helps eCommerce brands respond to social media comments automatically. The core challenge wasn't capability—it was trust. Every growth lead we interviewed had tried AI tools and stopped using them. They didn't trust what the AI was doing."

### The Pivot (20 sec)
"Halfway through the project, our target customer changed from startup founders to mid-sized eComm teams. Instead of panicking, we used V0 for rapid prototyping and ran weekly tests to reduce ambiguity fast."

### What I Built (30 sec)
"I owned three high-risk features: automation rules, brand voice, and the final inbox. For automation, I rejected a programming-style logic builder because users froze when they saw it. Instead, I designed rules that read like sentences—inspired by Apple Shortcuts. For brand voice, I made the AI's reasoning visible so users could see why it chose specific words."

### Results (20 sec)
"We improved the SUS score from 60 to 80 over six testing rounds. More importantly, users started asking how to scale the automation—which told me they trusted it enough to expand usage."

## WISE (60 seconds)

### The Gap I Identified (20 sec)
"This was a personal project where I identified a product gap. Wise handles multi-currency payments, but users still leave the app for Splitwise when traveling with friends. Every time they leave, Wise loses the transaction."

### What I Designed (20 sec)
"I designed a native split feature: create a group, add expenses in any currency, Wise handles the conversion. Recipients don't need a Wise account to see what they owe."

### Validation (20 sec)
"Three months after I made this, Wise shipped 'Spend with Others'—a group spending feature with the same core insight. I didn't predict their exact implementation, but the product gap I identified was real."

## WHY WHOP (45 seconds)

"At Athena, I've learned how to design AI tools that people actually trust. But the work is enterprise—I rarely see real users interact with what I build. Whop is the opposite: 200,000 weekly users, creators who depend on the platform to run their businesses. I want that direct feedback loop.

The problems are also familiar. Whop is building automation for creators—payments, access control, analytics. That's the same trust challenge I worked on at Blueberry: users need to see what's happening and feel confident it won't break.

I'm also comfortable with fintech complexity. The Wise project shows I can think through payment flows and multi-party transactions. And I work fast—the Blueberry pivot happened mid-project, and we still shipped."

## CLOSE (15 seconds)

"I'd love to talk more about how I could contribute to Whop's creator tools. Thanks for watching."

## DELIVERY NOTES

**Pacing:**
- Don't rush. Pauses are fine.
- Let the visuals breathe when you're showing the portfolio.

**Screen recording tips:**
- Have both case studies open in browser tabs
- Scroll slowly when showing each section
- Pause on the "what I rejected" and "what shipped" sections for Blueberry
- Pause on the validation callout for Wise

**What to show on screen:**
1. Portfolio homepage (briefly)
2. Blueberry case study - scroll through context → pivot diagram → what I rejected → what shipped
3. Wise case study - scroll through opportunity visual → solution prototypes → validation callout
4. End on portfolio homepage or a simple "Thanks" slide

**Key phrases to emphasize:**
- "Trust" (use this word multiple times)
- "Product thinking" (they explicitly want this over visual design)
- "Rapid prototyping" / "V0" (shows technical fluency)
- "Weekly testing" (shows process)
- "The gap I identified turned out to be real" (for Wise validation)
